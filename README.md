# build-a-blog
Assignment 4 of Unit 2 LC 101
In this assignment we were to learn and implement basic Flask routing and rendering, MySQL database structuring and querying and data storage. However, I wanted to see how much of a blog I could infact make. And since I was ahead in the class by three or four assignments, I figured I could take my time and complete it while the rest of the class cought up to where I was. So it's a little bit more than required but this is what I call fun. I really have enjoyed learning this technology and all the bits and pieces that go with it. I'm interested in hearing more advanced users opinion and how that tech is used in everyday production environments. I have to admit that having had more experice working with PHP I found the neccessity of installing moduale after module for things PHP does easily, especially considering that we're working out of a server (virtual) felt annoying. 

But all in all, I've had a total blast creating this project. It's not production level (nope!) but I could use it as an everyday blog and website no problem. Thank LaunchCode, this was interesting.
