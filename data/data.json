In 1983, he earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, and his doctoral thesis was titled 'The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints'. While working towards his doctorate, he wrote a version of emacs (gosmacs), and before joining Sun Microsystems he built a multi-processor version of Unix[1] while at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as several compilers and mail systems. Since 1984, Gosling has been with Sun Microsystems.</span></div><div class='p2'><span class='s1'></span><br /></div><div class='p1'><span class='s1'>He is generally credited as the inventor of the Java programming language in 1991. He did the original design of Java and implemented its original compiler and virtual machine. For this achievement, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Engineering. He has also made major contributions to several other software systems, such as NeWS and Gosling Emacs. He also co-wrote the 'bundle' program, a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book, 'The Unix Programming Environment'.</span></div><div class='p1'><span class='s1'><br /></span></div><h4><span class='s1'><b>Anders Hejlsberg - Turbo Pascal, C#, TypeScript</b></span></h4><div class='p1'><span class='s1'><a href='https://github.com/ahejlsberg'>Anders Hejlsberg</a> is a Microsoft Technical Fellow and has been designing and implementing programming languages and development tools for over 35 years.

Before joining Microsoft in 1996, Anders was a Principal Engineer at Borland International. As one of the first employees of Borland, he was the original author of Turbo Pascal and later worked as the Chief Architect of the Delphi product line. Anders studied Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark.</span></div><div class='p1'><span class='s1'><br /></span></div><h4><span class='s1'><b>Guido van Rossum - Python</b></span></h4><div class='p1'><span class='s1'><a href='https://gvanrossum.github.io/'>Guido van Rossum </a>is the creator of Python, one of the major programming languages on and off the web. Recently Guido retired as Benevolent Dictator For Life (“BDFL”) of Python, a title seemingly stolen from a Monty Python skit. Details of his decision were featured in an Economist article. Guido thankfully has joined the Python Steering Council. This five-person group will give guidance to the future roadmap of the Python programming language.</span></div><div class='p2'><span class='s1'></span><br /></div><div class='p1'><span class='s1'>Van Rossum moved from the Netherlands to the USA, in 1995.

So come talk to me.' Consequently, Mariatta did just that, she reached out to Guido after PyCon 2016 to learn more about starting in Python core development. Mariatta recalls, “I hadn’t contributed to open source [yet] and I wanted to know how to start”. Guido recommended some ways for Mariatta to start including reviewing the <a href='https://devguide.python.org/coredev/'>dev guide</a></span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>, looking at open issues and joining and introducing herself on the <a href='https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev'>Python dev mailing list</a></span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'><a href='https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev'> </a>.</span></div><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Following Guido’s advice, Mariatta “read the issues [to] see if there is anything I can help with, anything that interests me ... [when I learned that] Brett was starting migration [of Python] to GitHub”. As an engineer at Zapier, Mariatta has a background in web development so the migration provided an initial issue she could begin to explore. Mariatta has since contributed to several bots that improve the workflows for Python contributors and core developers, reviewed and merged 700+ PRs to Python, and is Co-Chair of the Language Summit in 2019 and 2020. Some examples of bots she has written include <a href='https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/'>cherry-picker</a>,</span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'> a “tool used to backport CPython changes from master into one or more of the maintenance branches”. Additionally, Mariatta is the author of <a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/'>PEP-581:</a></span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'><a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/'> Using GitHub Issues for CPython</a>. Her motivations behind this PEP again come back to improving the core Python development processes, “<span id='docs-internal-guid-f86c5d99-7fff-7556-8ed4-26902b37bc93'><span style='background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;'>I think it will be more beneficial to use an out of the box issue tracker like GitHub as it will allow core developers to focus on developing and contributing</span></span>”. </span></div><br /><h3 style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>A role model for us all: Increasing the diversity of the Core Python Development team</span></h3><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>The recent departure of Guido as BDFL and the subsequent discussion about the future governance of core Python led to several suggestions, with the <a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8016/'>Steering Council</a></span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'> ultimately becoming the chosen model. Core Python developer <a href='https://twitter.com/VictorStinner?lang=en'>Victor Stinner</a> along with several others <a href='https://discuss.python.org/t/steering-council-nomination-mariatta/670'>nominated Mariatta to the Steering Council</a></span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>. In Victor’s nomination he explains, “Mariatta became the first woman core developer in Python [in 2017]. She is </span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;'>actively sharing her experience to encourage people from underrepresented groups to contribute to Python.” The work required to become a core developer is laborious yet Mariatta has continuously gone the extra mile to lead by example and be active in public outreach. “Mariatta is my role model for mentoring and diversity which is helping a lot to get more people involved in Python,” Victor adds. Python core developer and Steering Council member <a href='https://twitter.com/WillingCarol?lang=en'>Carol Willing</a> echoed this sentiment sharing, “Mariatta works to share Python and its possible uses with others. Her blend of hard work, enthusiasm, and caring have welcomed many into the Python Community,”</span></div><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Mariatta’s PyCon 2018 talk titled, “<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhj7eb6TrtI'>What is a Core Python Developer</a>”</span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'> is an ideal example of Mariatta’s dedication to building a more diverse core Python team. Beginning with a question, “do you use f’strings” (Mariatta is a known avid fan of f’strings, she even has <a href='https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1051942829516189696'>stickers</a> for them) Mariatta dives into a talk about what the pathway is for core (and contributing) developers ultimately commenting on the very real, stark gender imbalance within the core team, “We have 848 contributors to Python, less than 10 are women</span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>. We have <a href='https://youtu.be/hhj7eb6TrtI?t=1842'>89 core developers, only 2 are women</a> ... This is real but this is also wrong. This is not the right representation of our community”. &nbsp;While this number is starting to change as more women are promoted to core development (<a href='https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-promote-cheryl-sabella-as-a-core-developer/862/38'>Cheryl Sabella’s promotion this week</a> </span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>ups the number of women core developers up to 5 out of 97), Mariatta has continued to be a champion and advocate for diversity and inclusion in the core development team. Even the captionist in Mariatta's PyCon 2018 (seen below in tweets) talk captured their appreciation for Mariatta's dedication.</span></div><br /><blockquote class='twitter-tweet' data-lang='en'><div dir='ltr' lang='en'>Heard a story today that brought me to tears.

The <a href='https://2018.pycascades.com/'>inaugural 2018 conference</a>, held in Mariatta’s hometown Vancouver, Canada, introduced a a single track format with 30 minute talks, no question and answer, and includes lightning talks. Inspired by the single track format of Write the Docs and DjangoCon Europe, this format was not only an easier way to get a new conference off the ground but, as Mariatta observed, “is able to give [speakers] the large audience they deserve”. This format also makes it easier for attendees to navigate. </span></div><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Co-Chairing the conference with Mariatta in 2018, <a href='https://twitter.com/elbaschid'>Seb Vetter</a></span><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'> remarked, “Mariatta has been THE driving force behind PyCascades in the inaugural year”. As a co-chair Mariatta helped respond to many last minute issues such as when, the day before the conference at 10:00am local time, Guido informed the organizers he was unable to obtain a visa to travel to speak at PyCascades. Within a few hours, the team setup for Guido to speak remotely, had sent him a badge, when the team learned Guido would be able to attend after all! “When we found out he's coming, we printed one more badge for him. That's why he has multiple badges,” Mariatta explained. Juggling many changing priorities is the life of an organizer. Yet each decision made, “she ensured … considered the potential impact on the diversity of the conference,” Seb remembered adding, “[Mariatta] seems to have an endless stream of enthusiasm and energy and was our North Star for doing everything we could to make it as inclusive for attendees as possible”. The idea of Mariatta acting as a North Star was echoed by PyCascades organizer <a href='https://twitter.com/ulysseas?lang=en'>Don Sheu</a> adding, “she gives voice to folks that aren’t sufficiently represented in tech … [as a part of] PyCascades founding team, Mariatta’s influence is creating a safe environment”.</span></div><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>With <a href='https://2019.pycascades.com/'>PyCascades 2019</a> happening in Seattle this upcoming weekend (February 23 - 24), Mariatta is again contributing as an organizer.</span></div><br /><h3 style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>What do f-string stickers and food have in common?

Although large events such as  PyCon US are incredibly important in bringing these groups together, these are not always accessible to the whole community. Smaller, localized events such as Python ES, France, Namibia, Colombia, and many many others help with the goal of bringing cohesion to the global community. <br /><br />According to <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidnaranjob/'>David Naranjo</a> (co-organiser of PyConES), PyConES was the first event of this kind that he and Mario attended together. They loved it so much that while at PyConES16 they decided to submit an application to organise and bring this event to their region: Extremadura.<br /><br />On top of the many challenges that come with organising an event of this type (i.e. drafting the programme, getting talks accepted, running the event on the day), they have faced an additional layer of complexity: neither of them lives in the region anymore.<br /><br />This has made the organisation of PyConES a true community effort: from the organising committee to the sponsors and the volunteers that work together to make this a huge success. PyConEs is now a&nbsp; staple Python event in Europe with more than 600 attendees every year, and it owes its success in a great deal to Mario’s efforts.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h4>PyLondinium</h4><br />A year after organising his first PyConES, Mario embarked on yet another journey: the organisation of <a href='https://pylondinium.org/'>PyLondinium</a>. An event focused on showcasing the many use cases of Python as opposed to other events such as the PyData events. <br /><br /><br />PyLondinium is not only focused on bringing together the Python community but also to raise money for the PSF and its programmes around the world. In this particular case, Bloomberg, a long-time Python supporter, has played an important role in the success of the event. Not only do they host the event at their Europe headquarters in the heart of London but they also help to cover some of the costs as the main event sponsor, keeping the ticket prices at an affordable level.<br /><br /><br /><br /><table align='center' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' class='tr-caption-container' style='margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;'><tbody><tr><td style='text-align: center;'><img height='266' src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vfjx-m6EMUnezkpf6EYB9fjOd5SfeQPpkRlDhk5GjNqvdDkQ3-zZhh1ZXWlQlOtj_B5eErvuQMtjvea-hIfJlG_JGfC4Txcye2HihXzmkTd3Vo_0AwQnMouGtfbFyiWY4WpCR4rP' style='margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;' width='400' /></td></tr><tr><td class='tr-caption' style='text-align: center;'><a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMemcP07dGKnXgeCQf9J4xiPC_rbKImGoZj9Beemxsx3BJJOmO2fhXmHn2HQhNtsA/photo/AF1QipNujEEYIGg0jR7wJNlWtuOM9l0zMVfC5PPyQ5y3?key=d1lkVHV5MTg0SlNuM1RDQ2tVMXRrM0FHZmZrd3d3' style='font-size: medium; text-align: start;'>Pylondinium 2018</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h4>Accessibility for the wider community</h4><div><br /></div>As a passionate community builder, from a non-English speaking country, localization and accessibility of the Python language is something that matters to Mario. Most of the coding resources out in the world are written in English, which can be a barrier to those whose primary language is not English or simply do not speak the language at all. That is why when he was presented with the opportunity to chair the Spanish track of PyCon US 2017 (<a href='https://twitter.com/pyconcharlas'>Las PyCon Charlas</a>) he did so wholeheartedly, embarking into yet another community journey alongside PSF Director Naomi Ceder.<br /><br />Again, like his other endeavours, Las Charlas was an absolute success. It gathered people from all over from Latin America and Spain for a full day of talks in Spanish on such topics as machine learning,  astronomy and security. In fact, it was such a success that the Charlas is back this coming year and the organisers are already receiving talks submissions (for more details visit <a href='https://us.pycon.org/2019/speaking/'>https://us.pycon.org/2019/speaking/</a>). <br /><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='font-family: &quot;comfortaa&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'><br /></span><br /><table align='center' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' class='tr-caption-container' style='margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;'><tbody><tr><td style='text-align: center;'><img height='300' src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/T3tJdhSSrx1G72Ni7GJDBwj7VrYpkQT6CJd8H6LLxBzPq2E_tm6IZWAyYJ1TjxcR_hjnePIF7L8uxRcbGE6wQ4C91UASPX78bEIj7UgUB_TPIqqrolas_KNE00wpJFo-NVgXsKPX' style='border: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; transform: rotate(0rad);' width='400' /></td></tr><tr><td class='tr-caption'><span id='docs-internal-guid-ee7e2b7a-7fff-9afc-e906-c72e9c91181b'><span style='font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline;'><span style='font-family: &quot;comfortaa&quot;; white-space: pre-wrap;'><span style='font-size: small;'>PyCon Charlas 2018</span></span></span></span><br /><div style='text-align: left;'><span id='docs-internal-guid-ee7e2b7a-7fff-9afc-e906-c72e9c91181b'><span style='font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline;'><br /></span></span></div><span id='docs-internal-guid-ee7e2b7a-7fff-9afc-e906-c72e9c91181b'><span style='font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline;'></span></span><div style='text-align: left;'><span id='docs-internal-guid-ee7e2b7a-7fff-9afc-e906-c72e9c91181b'><span style='font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline;'><br /></span></span></div><span id='docs-internal-guid-ee7e2b7a-7fff-9afc-e906-c72e9c91181b'><span style='font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline;'></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><span style='font-family: &quot;comfortaa&quot;; font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; vertical-align: baseline;'></span></div><span style='font-family: &quot;comfortaa&quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'><span id='docs-internal-guid-778b4b44-7fff-2b8a-1aa1-164351baabe7'></span></span></div>When asked why he organises all of these events, his answer is rather simple and honest. It is usually driven by a ‘how come no one is doing this yet?’' says Mario. But when digging deeper it becomes evident that Mario’s motivations lie in bringing the community together and nurturing it. Mario is extremely dedicated to the community and helping others to get involved. From creating Spanish tracks for PyCon USA or creating events serving specific areas or regions, Mario is constantly finding ways to bring Pythonistas together. <br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;comfortaa&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;'><br /></span></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;comfortaa&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;'><br /></span></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;comfortaa&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;'><br /></span></div>",

He is particularly impressed by the PSF’s efforts to support the growth of Python on multiple scales. “I don't think there's any organization like the PSF that does as much work issuing grants and supporting local groups teaching getting people involved in coding and Python.”</span></div><b style='font-weight: normal;'><br /></b><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;'><span style='background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'><img height='288' src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JAw7P-pCNeJx-nOoXgKgW36jzMMbxutYAwJY4A8fkYnfa34CjJPPFpr2tZaDrlCs1yNhLvU_6bexSGY48Fg7KGy1e_e6PYUltnhqT3pislqjne2tX_zDUWD1Uk8NBZW3JExbw0jr' style='-webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad); border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad);' width='191' /></span></div><b style='font-weight: normal;'><br /></b><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Moving forward, Alex hopes to see more knowledge being shared regarding potential funding in the community. “From PyPI to PyCon and beyond there's a lot of costs associated with making these community resources happen, and we've learned a lot about how to raise money to make them happen. I think we could do a better job sharing these lessons learned with the broader open source ecosystem and helping to push new innovation in this space.”</span></div><b style='font-weight: normal;'><br /></b><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Additionally, to anyone out there looking to make impactful contributions to our community, Alex’s advice is to simply jump in and contribute in whatever ways that work for you. With numerous volunteering opportunities with the PSF working groups, local meetups, regional conferences, and many more, it is easier than ever to be a part of, and help promote the Python community.</span></div><b style='font-weight: normal;'><br /></b><br /><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;'><span style='background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>As the final note, the PSF would like to congratulate Alex Gaynor again for this prestigious award, and thank him for his continued contributions to our organization in particular, and to the general Python community as a whole.</span></div></div>",

Within 4 different tracks, there were about 120 talks, 30 lightning talks and 6 keynotes, being the first Python Brasil to <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pg/pythonbrasil/videos/'>livestream</a> the whole main conference.&nbsp;</span></div><span id='docs-internal-guid-42b1e738-7fff-02a7-eec5-f0c5dbf5bb5a'><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;'><br /></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;'>Additionally, 5 tutorials, 1 sprint day and 1 independently organized Django Girls were held for those wanting more practical hands on.

To make it happen, the organization team created a specially priced ticket pack for the IFRN (Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte), allowing them to bring over 120 young students from 3 different cities. It was beautiful to see all these students around, watching talks, talking to the speakers and enjoying every moment of the conference.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>During the sprints, a group of students learned about data scraping. In a world where it is very hard to capture the attention of youths, it was fascinating to witness how they were so focused on learning. It demonstrates how a small gesture – like discounts on a ticket – can change people's lives.</div><div><br /></div><div>To express their gratitude, one of the students wrote and <a href='https://twitter.com/gabubellon/status/1054126829483761670'>presented</a> during the lighting talks a Python Brasil themed <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordel_literature'>Cordel</a> – a pamphlet with novels, poems and songs, very popular in that region – bringing some of the attendees to tears.</div></div><div><br /></div><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><a href='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AXc4n-DOH6Q/XFrdIWm4BHI/AAAAAAAB0fU/GSTeTG2kJNMB-e5rqn3Ew2-PRANQNbG3gCLcBGAs/s1600/kids.jpg' imageanchor='1' style='margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;'><img border='0' data-original-height='900' data-original-width='1600' height='180' src='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AXc4n-DOH6Q/XFrdIWm4BHI/AAAAAAAB0fU/GSTeTG2kJNMB-e5rqn3Ew2-PRANQNbG3gCLcBGAs/s320/kids.jpg' width='320' /></a></div><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><span id='docs-internal-guid-f447b0b0-7fff-fb3b-81e0-ad81a0464e6b'></span></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;'>Student presenting the Cordel</span></div><h3 style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: left;'></h3><div><h3>Financial Aid</h3></div><div><div>Besides the support for the students cited above, tickets were granted for people unable to pay for them.

Mediated by Mário Sérgio, five participants discussed topics like what is open data, how our legislation is currently dealing with it, tackling fake news, and what the expectations for the future are.

The motto of the conference was to help more women become active members of the Python community, inspiring those who were recently getting involved.<br /><br />Independently organized by the PyLadies, the conference happened one day before Python Brasil. The event was totally free, receiving about 120 women, with 8 speakers and ending in a fishbowl discussion. Likewise, the whole organization committee was formed only by women volunteers.<br /><br />The main organizer, <a href='https://twitter.com/pydebb'>Débora Azevedo</a>, said that it was five years cultivating the community, involving a lot of hard work to get them to this point.<br /><br /><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><a href='https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4Z5zC3mlQIw/XFreJbwB6cI/AAAAAAAB0fw/03w_iRdcqosExHmYT9hJ4aq985clcCxowCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/pyladies%2Bconf.jpeg' imageanchor='1' style='margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;'><img border='0' data-original-height='720' data-original-width='1280' height='180' src='https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4Z5zC3mlQIw/XFreJbwB6cI/AAAAAAAB0fw/03w_iRdcqosExHmYT9hJ4aq985clcCxowCPcBGAYYCw/s320/pyladies%2Bconf.jpeg' width='320' /></a></div><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><span id='docs-internal-guid-e64565e5-7fff-57a1-fe49-c3da3afcb8f4'><span style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>PyLadiesBRConf official photo</span></span></div><br /><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><a href='https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aNABGPQzpqs/XFreJpT-AsI/AAAAAAAB0f0/ZXFo4Sl3wE8nHhI6fXPv4Sg7I2G5wq_xQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/pyladies.jpg' imageanchor='1' style='margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;'><img border='0' data-original-height='620' data-original-width='1600' height='124' src='https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aNABGPQzpqs/XFreJpT-AsI/AAAAAAAB0f0/ZXFo4Sl3wE8nHhI6fXPv4Sg7I2G5wq_xQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/pyladies.jpg' width='320' /></a></div><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><span id='docs-internal-guid-3dc439cf-7fff-69df-5674-b7a48c7c3199'><span style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>PyLadies at Python Brasil</span></span></div><br /><h3>Dorneles Treméa Award</h3></div><div><div>Named after the founder of the Python Brasil Association, <a href='https://python.org.br/premio-dorneles-tremea/'>the award</a> is a tribute to Dorneles Treméa, a developer, community member, and open source leader, always willing to help and share his knowledge, who sadly passed away in a car accident in 2011.

Adapting the budget, venues, and logistics was a big challenge.'</i></blockquote><br />Ítalo Monteiro:<br /><blockquote class='tr_bq'><i>'The challenge was to promote the best infrastructure for the biggest Python Brasil in history, making it a safe space for everyone, not accepting any kind of prejudice or intolerance.'</i></blockquote>When asked about the future of the conference and the community, all of the organizers said they wanted to improve the diversity of the event even further. Having more women attending and speaking, more participation of beginners and more involvement of minorities. Additionally, they all want to have a bigger and more united community, believing in its growth, visibility, and engagement.</div></div></div></div><div><br /></div><div><h3>People &gt; Technology</h3></div><div>My first contact with the Python community was at Python Brasil in 2016 and it changed my life.<br />A lot of the experiences and opportunities that I had – personally and professionally – came from being part of it. It's not just about the technology, it's about the people.<br /><br />Of course, this wasn't the <i>whole</i> conference, there's no way to cover every amazing thing that happened there. At least, I hope to get you excited to go to the next one!<br /><br />I'd like to say thanks to all the organization committee and everyone involved in putting together this superb conference and helping me with this article.</div><div><br /></div><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><a href='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PfyrUsdvSTI/XFrfLOEEXcI/AAAAAAAB0gE/xVe5UMy3H_kWsCqySV6ylDOok9XAOlragCLcBGAs/s1600/oficial.jpg' imageanchor='1' style='margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;'><img border='0' data-original-height='1067' data-original-width='1600' height='213' src='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PfyrUsdvSTI/XFrfLOEEXcI/AAAAAAAB0gE/xVe5UMy3H_kWsCqySV6ylDOok9XAOlragCLcBGAs/s320/oficial.jpg' width='320' /></a></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: pre;'>Python Brasil official photo.</span></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: pre;'>The sign represents Python in BSL (Brazilian Sign Language), </span></div><div class='separator' style='clear: both; text-align: center;'><span id='docs-internal-guid-a69807ba-7fff-ea33-0a61-3a4aa99b30b3'></span></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: pre;'>made by Amanda and Sávio at Python Sul 2018</span></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;'><span style='background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: pre;'><br /></span></div><div dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;'></div><div style='text-align: left;'><br /></div><div>You can take a peek at this wonderful conference’s <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/pythonbrasil/albums/72157674858185438'>photos</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqXYEL0SmyM&amp;list=PLDC3uVLxaEQ3Jd6ZNeNyEoCNkp05vRujQ'>videos</a>.<br /><br /><i>The Python Brasil[15] will happen at Ribeirão Preto, in São Paulo.

   "content": "In the fall of 2018, the Python Software Foundation together with JetBrains conducted the official annual Python Developers Survey for the second time. Much like the <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2017/'>previous survey</a>, we set out to identify the latest trends and gather insight into how the world of Python development looks . Over twenty thousand developers from more than 150 different countries participated last year to help us map out an accurate, up-to-date landscape of the Python community. That is more than twice as many Python users participating in 2018 as in 2017. We are super-excited to share the results of the survey with you!<br /><br /><a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/'>View the results of Python Developers Survey 2018!&nbsp;</a><br /><br />We hope the survey findings will help all of us better understand the current state of the Python developer community, see the big picture, and answer some potential questions. Find out about the most popular types of Python development, trending frameworks, libraries and tools, additional languages used together with Python, adoption rates of different Python versions, and gain many other insights into the world of Python.<br /><br />We couldn’t include all the potential findings into the report without bloating it. If you have specific questions that are unanswered, <a href='mailto:surveys@python.org'>send them to us</a> and we’ll dig into the data for an answer. Or if you want to delve into the data yourself, we’re also sharing the <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#methodology'>raw survey data</a>, which anyone can use to arrive at their own conclusions and additional findings.<br /><br />We’re excited to see and share your findings! Please share them on twitter or other social media mentioning <a href='https://twitter.com/jetbrains'>@jetbrains</a>\u200f and <a href='https://twitter.com/ThePSF'>@ThePSF</a> with the <b>#pythondevsurvey</b> hashtag. We’re open to any suggestions and feedback related to the survey so we can run an even better one next time.<br />&nbsp;<br />Huge thanks to all the participants of the survey and to the amazing team at PSF and JetBrains that worked hard to make this happen!<br /><div><br /></div>",

If you had $10,000,000 USD  what would you do? <br /><br />There is no limit to the amount of money that your pitch might cost. If we think you have a great idea and it serves to improve Python in education, we will support it. Smaller requests will       come from funds we have on hand. Larger funding requests will take more work to fulfill as we will work to gather funds through several methods such as donation drives and grants from other organizations. <br /><br />While the Request for Ideas is vague and open ended, there are some guidelines. These guidelines will come into play during the Request for Proposal phase, but they may help you in the Request for Ideas phase.<br /><br />Here are some things that we will look for and consider in a proposal:<br /><br /><h4>Basic requirements</h4><br /><ul><li>The criteria for acceptance will be based on the following guidelines:</li><li>Does the proposal adhere to <a href='https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/'>PSF’s Code of Conduct</a>?</li><li>Does the proposal align with the <a href='https://www.python.org/psf/mission/'>Python Software Foundation’s mission</a>?</li><li>Is the proposal well organized and detailed? Be sure to tell us what the main issue, problem, or subject is and why is it important.&nbsp;</li><li>Does the proposer have any experience relevant to the proposal? While not strictly a requirement, having previous experience in what is being proposed will be considered in the overall application.</li><li>Is the subject pertaining to underrepresented topics within our community? As we strive to improve the diversity of our community, priority will be given to proposals that bring new viewpoints and additional representation to the Python ecosystem.</li></ul><br /><h4>Advanced requirements</h4><br /><ul><li>The proposal should include a timeline and capture major milestones for the work being proposed.</li><li>If the proposal includes assistance from other contributors/resources, please share the details.</li><li>The proposal should include the expected outcomes of proposed work as well as metrics for how the outcomes will be evaluated.</li></ul><div><br /></div><h4>Submit your ideas and questions to <a href='mailto:edu-committee@python.org'>edu-committee@python.org</a>.</h4></div><div><br /></div><div>Thank you for your time and we look forward to seeing all of the wonderful ideas!</div>",
